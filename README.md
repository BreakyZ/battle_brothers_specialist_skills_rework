Mod that reworks almost all the specialist weapon perks (Poacher's arm ie).  

* Will scale 10% per level with 0 bonuses for non specialist weapon at 1 and 100% at 11. Has a menu option if you want to have it scale by 5% weekly (SSU style).
* The specialist weapons will always receive 100%.
* Damage specialist perks are merged into skill specialist perks and will unlock when you take the respective weapon mastery.
* Butcher's perks will apply to all cleavers.
* Musical instrument specialisation will apply to 1h maces with different bonuses and up to 2 extra fatigue damage done per attack.
* Ninetails perks have overall been nerfed since now there's a scaling ceiling so I gave them some extra headshot damage. Will apply to 3 headed flail and berserker chain now.
* Militia perks give 6 bonus defense.
* Pickaxe will apply to Military Pick as well.
* Scythe is merged into pitchfork.
* Added a new Inventor Specialist perk which applies to Firearms, Firelances and Crossbows. No damage bonus unless you're using Firelances, but will reduce reload speed by 1 when taking Crossbow mastery. Added to Adaptive perk when Firearm or Firelance is equipped.
* Added a new 2 handed sword perk for Sellswords and Retired Soldiers.
* Added another crossbow perk group to Witchhunters and Youngbloods.
* Axe and spear perks will apply to throwing weapons with new Legends update.
* Daytaller now has the pitchfork perks.
* Perk descriptions edited in Rygar's style

TODO:
* add unique bonuses to all the perks.
* add breditor support
* change which perk sellswords get from SSU.

Requires Modern Hooks and is maybe/probably not safe to add mid run. Compatible with SSU.
