Smallish mod that reworks almost all the specialist weapon perks (Poacher's arm ie) to scale with stats for all the weapons it normally impacts. 

* Will take your largest stat amongst Initiative, HP and Resolve up to a maximum bonus of 150.
* Will scale slower under 100 and faster over 100.
* The specialist weapons will receive a 25% innate boost and 25% above the maximum bonus.
* Scythe specialization applies to 2 handed swords.
* Butcher's perks will apply to all cleavers.
* Musical instrument specialisation will apply to 1h maces.
* Ninetails perks have overall been nerfed since now there's a scaling ceiling so I gave them some extra headshot damage. Will apply to 3 headed flail and berserker chain now.
* Added crossbows to militia perks
